description: 'Officially supported topics on TabbedOut Wikis'

We want to support as many topics in as many languages as possible, but this may become a challenge in terms of infrastructure and oversight. We care that each addition has a strong administration team capable of controlling the flow of content well enough.

## Languages

For the time being, the list is very limited due to a lack of translated privacy policy, terms of use, and official guidelines in those languages.

Here are the languages we currently support:
* English

## Games

Every game with a reasonably sized playerbase and/or administration team is worthy of its own wiki. The only hard rule here is that the game itself is appropriate to display on the website. If you are curious what this includes, please refer to the terms of use.

We support the following games:
* Clair Obscur: Expedition 33
* Final Fantasy XIV

Upcoming games we have interest in:
* Darksiders 4
* Ananta (weeb game)
