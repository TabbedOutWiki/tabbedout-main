**Shortcode templates** are shortcuts to highly repetitive pieces of page content or to insert HTML that isn't available in markdown files on a page. This allows for further customization than typical markdown allows, as well as control over the type of content that may be shown on the website without the need for external moderation.

We offer a set of default templates to every TabbedOutWiki. These may be overwritten, and custom shortcodes may be written specific to any wiki. Any shortcodes proven to be greatly useful across a range of wikis may be transitioned over to our default library.

Here we will list templates included by default. This list may not always be up to date, please refer to the official GitHub repository for a fully updated list.
